This tool uses geolocation and GIS to empower voters to locate the easiest site for them to use to cast their vote. This product was developed with Nevada in mind, and accommodates Nevada's unique early voting system. Even though early voting locations vary by day, the Polling Location Lookup always allows voters to find the closest open polling location to them each day. The functions of this tool are modular, and can operate as a stand alone site or they can be embedded in existing sites or resources. This tool was used in Nevada by President Barack Obama's Re-Election Campaign in 2012."}
